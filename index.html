            <p>Organizing your tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make you feel grounded. Seeing a clear outline of your completed and uncompleted tasks will help you feel organized and stay mentally focused. As you cross items off your to-do list, you'll feel a sense of progress and accomplishment that can be missed when rushing from one activity to the next. The affirmation that you are making progress will help motivate you to keep moving forward rather than feeling overwhelmed.</P>

          <p>If you record all your tasks in a to-do list, you can easily review the list and prioritize the most important tasks. Why waste time on trivial activities when there are important matters that need your attention? One study, conducted by the Harvard Business Review, showed that 90% of managers wasted valuable time through poor time management. Your to-do list will help you focus your attention on the most important task of the moment.</p>

          <p>Motivational speakers will tell you that to-do lists are a useful motivational tool when used as a way to clarify goals. It's easy to say, "I want to get that promotion," but listing the steps that you intend to take to accomplish that goal can help clarify your thoughts and give you achievable short-term goals. As you succeed at each step along the way, you'll gain confidence crossing those items off your list!</p>
